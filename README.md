# LumaDB

## Introduction

**LumaDB** is a groundbreaking database that leverages the principles of **3D light fields** used in game environments to store and manage data. This project encodes data as properties of light rays within a 3D voxel grid, transforming how spatial data is stored, queried, and visualized. It is designed for high-performance, real-time applications such as gaming, virtual reality, and simulations, with a distributed architecture that ensures scalability and reliability.

## Key Features

- **3D Light-Based Encoding**: 
  Data points are represented as light voxels, each carrying attributes like intensity, color, and direction.
  
- **Custom Consensus Protocol**: 
  A tailored distributed protocol ensures data consistency across nodes while maintaining fault tolerance.

- **Spatial Indexing**: 
  Efficient data storage and retrieval using advanced spatial indexing techniques such as octrees or kd-trees.

- **3D Query Language**: 
  A query language designed to handle spatial queries based on the location and properties of light.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust**: 
  The primary language for the core system, chosen for its speed, memory safety, and concurrency.

- **Elixir**: 
  (Optional) Used for managing distributed systems and ensuring scalability with its fault-tolerant nature.

- **OpenGL** / **WebGL**: 
  For rendering 3D visualizations of data for spatial queries.

- **gRPC / WebSockets**: 
  Communication protocols for low-latency data transfers between nodes in a distributed system.

- **Custom Data Structures**: 
  Tailored to manage voxel-based light field data and optimize storage and query performance.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Input data is transformed into 3D light field representations and stored within a voxel grid.

2. **Data Query**: 
   - Users can perform spatial queries using the custom query language, returning data based on its light attributes and spatial location.

3. **Real-Time Updates**: 
   - The system supports dynamic updates, adjusting light voxels in real-time as new data is ingested or queried.

4. **Distributed Operations**: 
   - A custom consensus protocol ensures that data remains consistent across multiple nodes, even in case of failures.
